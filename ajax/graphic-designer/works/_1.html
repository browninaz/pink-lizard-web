    Floating Leaf Aquatics is a minimalist Aquascaping hobbyist blog developed in 2018. The idea behind the design was based on less distraction from clutter along with high quality images and content. We focused on user experience as the most important aspect of this project and started our build from that foundation.

    This piece serves as a critique of the increasing commercialization of the art world. Makes the viewer question the very idea of installation as art, as the work is in fact the negation of installation—the insulation was never installed between any
    of the floors. As a result, the viewer is forced to engage with the dialogue of other gallery visitors, whose conversations are audible in their entirety.
